# Preparing for a Tech Talk, Part 1: Motivation
I’ve done a few tech talks that I think went well.

Sometimes people ask me how I prepare for a talk. For every speaker, the answer is very personal. I’m just sharing what works for me.

This is the first post in a series where I will explain my process preparing for a tech talk — from conceiving the idea to the actual day of the presentation.

In this post, I will only focus on the first step: why and how I pick a topic. It’s not rich in practical tips but might help you ask yourself the right questions.
